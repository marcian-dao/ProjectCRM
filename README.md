# ProjectCRM

This is modern (experimental) Customer Relationship Management project. 

The purpose of the project is to show to the potential employers my abilities to build a fully functional software using back, and front-end technologies, such as:

Java, Spring-MVC, Spring-Security, Spring AOP, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, JSP, Thymeleaf, Html5, CSS3.
  
Project is linked to external DB on AWS servers, so there is no need to use MySQL scripts.

All of the emloyers are free to download or clone this project if needed.
