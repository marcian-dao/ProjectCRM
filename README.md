# ProjectCRM

This is modern (experimental) Customer Relationship Management project. 

The purpose of the project is to show to the potential employers my abilities to build a fully functional software using back, and front-end technologies, such as:

  Java, Spring-MVC, Spring-Security, Spring AOP, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, JSP, Thymeleaf, Html5, CSS3.
  
Folder "projectCRM_MySQL_scripts" contains all necessary MySQL scripts to create Database schema, needed to run this project with all included features.

All of the emloyers are free to download or clone this project if needed.
