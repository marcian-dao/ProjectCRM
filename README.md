# ProjectCRM

This is experimental Customer Relationship Management repository. 

The purpose of the project is to show to the potential employers my abilities to build a fully functional software using back, and front-end technologies, such as:

Java, Spring-MVC, Spring-Security, Spring AOP, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, JSP, Thymeleaf, Html5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

The content visible to the user differs deppending on User_Role, where Admin has the most privileges. 
  
This project is linked to the external DB on AWS servers, so there is no need to use MySQL scripts.

If you prefer to do the quick test rather then downloading or cloning the entire project, please check:
